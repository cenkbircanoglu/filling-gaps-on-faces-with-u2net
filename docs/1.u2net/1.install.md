## Using Conda

_If you have GPU support, you can use `conda-gpu.yml`_
 
- Create conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f conda-gpu.yml
```

- You may need to run one of these if you are new on conda

```bash
conda init bashrc
conda init zsh
```

- Activate conda environment

```bash
conda activate img2img
```
